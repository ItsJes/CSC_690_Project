# CSC_690_Project
This project is a classic snake game with bombs add.
Player well be able to control the snake. The goal of the game is to get your snake as long
as possible by feeding it and beating the best score. Everytime you feed the snake, the snake will grow and the speed will in crease and score will in crease. Bombs will appear at random and if you hit the bomb you loose the game. You will also loose the game if you touch any part of you snake with the front of the snake.

# Proposal:
The must features this game should have is the basic rules of snake such as game ends when the head of the snake touches any part of the snake, speed should increase as you snake grows, and score increase. The must added feature I will add are random bombs that pop up which is another way for you to loose the game. Bombs should only be there for a short duration. The game will have a basic menu that has the game title and a play button. Once the play button is pressed the board, score, best score, and snake will display on screen and start. 

The nice to have features that I would love to add to the game is adding random power ups to appear. I would like to have a random food appear one for slowing down and one for invincibility. The slow down one would slow to the snake by the amount a normal food would have increased it and the invincibility will make you invincible for a short amount of time so if you hit yourself or a bomb during that duration the game won't end.
